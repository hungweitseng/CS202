This directory contains the source code for a kernel module. 
You may try to "make" with root permission (e.g. "sudo make"). 
If it success, you will see a "mymodule.ko" under this directory. 

You can then type "make all" using root permission to install the 
kernel module and the header into system directories. After you are 
done with this, you can now "insmod mymodule.ko" using root. If 
this success, you can navigate to /dev directory and you should 
see a "mymodule" device under this directory!
